# For Contributors

## Welcome

Welcome to the `Contributors Guide` for Execexam!

## Getting Started

To contribute to Execexam, you must have [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

To set up a development environment for `execexam`, first clone the Execexam repository.

`git clone git@github.com:GatorEducator/execexam.git`

Then, in your copy of `execexam`, run poetry install. This will install all of Execexam's runtime and development dependencies. Now, you can begin to contribute to the GatorGrade project following the guidelines below.

## Contributing Changes

### GitHub Flow

Execexam is maintained using the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) workflow. This means that before making any changes to your copy of Execexam, you should [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-branch) off of the main branch. The name of the branch should be a short, descriptive name that describes the changes you plan on making in the branch. For example, if you are planning to update the README.md, you might name your branch update-readme. Notice that the branch name should be all lowercase and have words separated by hyphens.

### Testing Changes

Running Execexam Locally
As you make changes, you will want to see how they affect the output of Execexam. To do this, in the branch that contains your changes, run:

`poetry build`
This will build an archive (i.e. a release artifact) of Execexam that contains your changes. To use this archive, you can install it with pipx:

`pipx install dist/execexam-<archive-version>.whl`
Then, you can run the `execexam` commands in any assignment repository to view the output of Execexam with your changes.

If you have already done this, have made additional changes, and would like to try out your most recent changes, we recommend that you first uninstall Execexam with pipx:

`pipx uninstall execexam`
Then, you can proceed with building and installing a new Execexam archive.

### Running the Test Suite

You should also test that your changes have not caused any regressions in the Execexam system. You can do this by running:

`poetry run task test`
This will run the test task defined in the pyproject.toml, which will execute all of the tests. You can be confident that your changes have not caused any regressions if all tests pass.

Additionally, you should lint your changes to make sure they follow the stylistic rules of the Execexam project. You can do this by running:

`poetry run task lint`
This will run the lint task, which executes various linters such as pylint, that ensure that the style of your changes matches the rest of GatorGrade. Any linting errors that appear should be addressed.

### Committing Changes

As you make and test changes, you should be making small, focused, and targeted commits. Additionally, commit messages should follow these guidelines:

Should be 50 characters or less (soft limit - exceptions include co-author or function names for example)
Should be in the imperative mood
Should be void of all grammatical and spelling mistakes

### Pull Requests

Once you have finished making and committing your changes to your branch, you should [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-pull-request) so that others can review your changes. Before creating a pull request, make sure that the last commit in your branch produced a passing build in GitHub Actions. When you create a pull request, please make sure to fill out all portions of the template.

### Version Tag

In this repo we have two ways to version tag that will automatically push the current version to PyPI. The first way is a test tag that will test the automatic publishing feature to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/execexam/) using [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/execexam/). 

#### Test Publish

The purpose of test publish action is to test the publishing process itself. To test publish use the lowercase `t` tag. A test publish tag should look like `t0.3.1`.

Example Commands for Test Publish:

- `poetry version 0.3.1`
- `git add pyproject.toml`
- `git commit -m "Chore: Bump version to 0.3.1"`
- `git tag t0.3.1`
- `git push origin t0.3.1`

#### Publish

The purpose of the publish action is to automatically publish the version to PyPI. The publish action uses the lowercase `v` tag. A tag for publishing should look like `v0.3.1`.

Example Commands for Publish:

- `poetry version 0.3.1`
- `git add pyproject.toml`
- `git commit -m "Chore: Bump version to 0.3.1"`
- `git tag v0.3.1`
- `git push origin v0.3.1`
